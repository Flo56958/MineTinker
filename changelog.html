                        <p class="mbr-timeline-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Added Directing-Modifier: Items go directly to Inventory (dropping when full). Only combinable with Luck on the Sword and Bow. Not combinable with Silk-Touch. (Due to coding difficulties)
<br>Added Melting-Modifier: Bonus damage against burning enemies! (B/SW)
<br>Added Webbed-Modifier: Slows down enemies!  (B/SW)
<br>
<br>Added the config-option to change the Lore-lines of the MineTinker-Tools. (IMPORTANT: LevelLine and ExpLine can't have Spaces, FreeModifierSlotsLine NEEDS exactly TWO spaces)
<br>Added the WOOD block to the Timber-Modifier as a viable block. (for different world generators)
<br>
<br>Updated /mt mods reply
<br>
<br>Bow can get XP like the sword. (important for EnableDamageXP)
<br>
<br>Spawners now can be turned of entirely.
<br>Spawners now have the allowed worlds option as well.
<br>
<br>Created Modifiers now longer drop to the ground if the Inventory has space
<br>Drops from a LevelUp-Event now longer drop to the ground if the Inventory has space
<br>
<br>Most messages are now in the Actionbar instead of the Chat.
<br>You can turn of Chat and Actionbar messages entirely in the Config. (disabling chat means also disabling command output in the chat!)
<br>
<br>MineTinker now will not convert Tools in the crafting output which have a ItemMeta on them (e.g. Tools from other Plugins)
<br>
<br>Code improvements
<br>Codestyle improvements<br><br>Added give-command to give you a MineTinker-Tool
<br>Added Convert-Command to convert a tool to a MineTinker-Tool
<br>Added Reload-Command to reload the config.
<br>Added language-options for some command-output in the config.
<br>Added option to turn off crafting tools (for compatibility with other Plugins)
<br>Added the soft-dependency WorldGuard to MineTinker (as requested by kaimokene [#16])
<br> - Builderswands should not ignore claimed land anymore
<br>Added int and long Overflow-protection for Level-, Exp-counter (Resets at overflow to 0 or 1 or stops if ResetAtVarOverflow is false in the config)
<br>Added int Overflow-protection for free-Slots-counter (free-Slots-counter will not be reset and stays at MAX_VALUE)
<br>Reorganized Command.onHelp() alphabetically.
<br>Changed exp-Variable type from int to long for even more Exp-farming
<br>Special Items (e.g. Builderswand and Elevator-Motor) can be renamed in the config.
<br>Bows to not trigger the Self-Repair chance two times anymore (Self-Repair is therefore nerved for the bow to the level of the sword)
<br>
<br>Redesigned if-statements of the Elevator-Listener (error by kaimokene [#17])
<br>Removed unnecessary try/catch-statements and replaced them with instanceof<br></p>

                    <p class="mbr-timeline-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">This is by far the biggest update to come to MineTinker. It has cost me over 30 hours to code, test and optimized. (Not every change is noted below) I hope you enjoy it :)
<br>
<br>Added a better modifier system (it is mostly code-based and should not affect overall experience but performance). Expect older tools not working anymore. (and other bugs)
<br>
<br>Armor-Integration:
<br>Added Protecting-Modifier for armor (adds Enchantment Protection to armor)
<br>Added Light-Weight-Modifier for boots
<br>Armor gets Exp when player is hit.
<br>Armor can be repaired. (Be aware your armor can break!)
<br>Armor can be upgraded.
<br>Armor can be upgraded to chainmail with iron bars.
<br>You can give yourself MineTinker-Armor through commands.
<br>Possible Modifiers for Armor: Protecting, Self-Repair, Webbed, Poisonous, Shulking, Melting (to OP atm), Light-Weight for boots, Reinforced (more to come in the future)
<br>
<br>Auto-Smelt will now burn coal.
<br>Added option to Power to break blocks vertically when at level 1.
<br>Directing will only work on Sword, Bow and Axe when killing mobs (due to bugs).
<br>The Modifier XP is now called Experienced.
<br>
<br>EasyHarvest is my other Plugin which is now integrated in MineTinker: (https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/easyharvest.54319/)
<br>Added EasyHarvest-Features! (harvest crops while right-clicking them with a Hoe and replant them automatically)
<br>EasyHarvest works with Power on the Hoe.
<br>
<br>Removed /mt reload as it makes complications with new modifier system.<br>Fixed: Every crafted item gets lore from MineTinker (reported by Dulty)<br>Timber-Modifier is craftable again (reported by𝓐𝔃𝓾𝓻𝓮)&nbsp;<br><br>- EasyHarvest can now harvest nether warts as well
<br>- Ender now can be configured to be not compatible with Infinity (default: Ender IS compatible with Infinity)<br><br>Tweaks:
<br> - EasyHarvest will not use Power when sneaking
<br> - EasyHarvest will work with new Power-option (lv1_vertical)
<br> - Creating farmland with the hoe will work with new Power-option (lv1_vertical)
<br> - The Language options can now be altered without restrictions
<br>
<br>Bugfixes:
<br> - Leveling-Up will now increase the free Slots by the configured amount.
<br> - Tool-Upgrade will now function as planned (reported by @𝓐𝔃𝓾𝓻𝓮)
<br> - Fixed Spawners (reported by @𝓐𝔃𝓾𝓻𝓮)
<br> - Fixed Modifiers not removing a free Slot from the Tool when modding (reported by BinklyBibbler)<br>&nbsp;- Modifiers now can be disabled without disabling other modifiers with errors (e.g. Luck and Silk-Touch) (reported by @Vicarious)
<br> - Crafting the Light-Weight-Modifier will now cost the configured amount of levels (reported by @zGraYzPanda)
<br> - Fixed Luck-Description (reported by @Dulty)
<br> - Webbed is now compatible with Power (check was unnecessarily in the code)<br></p>

                        <p class="mbr-timeline-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Additions:

<br>- Each Modifier has its own config-file now (by @Vicarious)
<br>- New config-files for Builderswands (by @Vicarious)
<br>- The Description of each Modifier in /mt mods can be altered in the config (/mt mods can be as a little in-Game-Wiki)
<br>- The Modifier-Item-Name in the description is the name of the modifier-item (all Modifier-Items are renamed instead of a generic XXX-Modifier) [Be sure to use all crafted modifier-items before updating]

<br> - Added GiveModifierItem-command, which allows operators to add modifier items to their inventory (requested by @Vicarious )
<br> - Readded a new version of the /mt reload command, which reloads almost all configurations of MineTinker. If MineTinker becomes unstable or outputs errors, report them on discord. A restart of the server should fix the issue. (requested by @Vicarious )

<br> - Added a toggleable HideEnchants-option in the config (requested by @Matt | Kalcight )

<br>- Auto-Smelt:
<br>  - added config-option smelt_stone: stone will drop stone (as Silk-Touch) if enabled (by @Vicarious)

<br>  - enhanced Algorithm

<br>- Modifying through the Anvil is now more intuitive as it works like a normal Anvil-Recipe (shift-clicking works now!) (by @j_l_1998)<br>&nbsp;- AllowedWorlds are now a blacklist and called BannedWorlds [makes the plugin more end-user-friendly and easier to set up]
<br> - Auto-Smelt smelts now red sand to red glass (requested by @Vicarious)
<br> - You can now apply more Modifiers at a time through the anvil<br>
<br>Bugfixes:
<br>- Fixed /mt convert command as it would not convert tools only not tools (reported by @Pepek)<br>- [CRITICAL!] Fixed Bug, where Modifiers were unloaded, because they failed to apply on the tool at a LevelUp-Event (reported by @TriZ) (by @j_l_1998)
<br> - Timber will now work with 2x2 spruce trees (reported by @Matt | Kalcight)
<br> - Beheading can be applied again
<br> - Power on the Pickaxe will break Ice again (be careful as Power will break every Block - except Air and BedRock - on the pickaxe) (reported by @Dulty)
